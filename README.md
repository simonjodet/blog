# Simon's Blog #
This github repository contains [my personal blog](http://blog.jodet.com)'s source files.

## Description ##
This repository contains all the development I've done on my personal blog.
It is built with [Gumdrop](http://simonjodet.github.com/gumdrop/), styled with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), connected to Twitter with [Tweet!](http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/) and enhanced with custom JavaScript code of my own.
If you wish to know more about how this blog is built, read [this post about it](http://blog.jodet.com/posts/2012-08-26-gumdroping-this-blog.htm).
