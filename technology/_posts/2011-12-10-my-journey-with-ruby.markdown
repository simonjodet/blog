I'm a developer. But as a developer, I'm fairly faithful. I really seriously started programming with PHP. I learned and use this language thouroughly. I consider myself an expert programmer in this language.

It's more or less my native language. My second language is JavaScript. I started playing with it a long time ago but really discovered its power in 2007 with Mootools.  
Yes Mootools! jQuery is for sissies! Just kidding, jQuery is fine but if you want to really learn JavaScript, try Mootools or ExtJS, read [this](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596101992.do), Crockford's [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) and watch [his lectures](http://yuiblog.com/crockford/).

I've played with other languages, some really close to what I know (ActionScript is just JavaScript), others a little more different (Python). Python is nice but we have our fair share of Python developers at the office and what's the fun of learning a new language if you have the security of being able to ask the guy next door.

So as you probably guessed with this article's title, I've decided to learn Ruby. And I decided to document this journey. I don't if it'll help anybody but, heh, why not?  
So to be fair, I've tried Ruby before. Not very seriously. And because of this blog actually. It's built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is a Ruby program. When I wanted to change some stuff I realized I should probably learn Ruby first.

This introduction is already way too long so let's get to the point. Right now I think Ruby is:

* A pretty cool language, clearly designed for the convenience of the developer, with a lot of alternative syntaxes and shortcuts.  
  The language is, I feel, sometimes a bit too forgiving, leaving the developer free to write bad code without realizing it.
* blah
