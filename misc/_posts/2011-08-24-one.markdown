Ok. For the _tenth_ time at least, I'm starting a blog. I'm like a little school girl promising to herself every year to keep a diary. Epic fail each time...

Every time, there is a good reason for me to start a blog. This time around, I really wanted to use Jekyll and get rid of Wordpress.

Wordpress is probably one of the best blog engine out there. However, it doesn't fit my needs and has a number of major flaws:

* Wordpress is too stressful. I mean my blog got hacked a couple of time with 0-day injection issues. This engine is way to much used and like Windows is a favorite target for hackers.
* I don't need this bloated engine to write maybe ten posts in total before I switch to something else again. 
* Jekyll seems to be a nice little tool and it gives me an excuse to use 2 things I've been using a lot lately: Git and markdown-like writing with Sphynx.
