Still on my journey to learning the Ruby language, I've ported a small PHP script I've written a while ago to quickly eject external drives on my MacBook Pro in Ruby.

I converted it to [an app](/uploads/usb_eject.app.zip) with Automator

Here is the code (MIT license):

Comments and critics are welcome.
